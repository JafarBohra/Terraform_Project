> "This repository is dedicated to learning and exploring Terraform, an open-source infrastructure as code tool. Through this project, I aim to share best practices, configurations, and examples to help others understand how to manage and provision infrastructure efficiently using Terraform. Whether you're new to Terraform or looking to deepen your knowledge, this repository offers various scripts and configurations for different environments and use cases. Contributions and feedback are welcome as we grow and learn together!"
